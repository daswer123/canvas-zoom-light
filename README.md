# Canvas zoom lite
### A lite version of [canvas-zoom](https://github.com/richrobber2/canvas-zoom) containing only the necessary functions. This version does not contain the modified gradio.

## Key Features:
1) You can zoom with **Shift+wheel** hotkey in the image area, the zoom goes where the mouse pointer points
2) You can move the canvas with the **F** key over the whole screen area
3) There is a full screen **S** mode which automatically stretches the whole picture so that it would fit the width and height.
4) Changing the size of a brush with a hotkey ( **Ctr+wheel** ). Quick and easy brush resizing
5) There is a button **O** which allows you to overlap the elements (This is mostly done automatically, but you have the ability to manually remove if necessary, a technical button).

## Hotkeys 
**Hotkeys work only in the image area and do not cause conflicts**

**F (hold)** - Move canvas

**Shift + wheel** - Scale canvas

**Ctr + wheel** - Change brush size

**S** - Fullscreen mode, zoom in on the canvas so that it fits into the screen.

**R** - Reset Zoom.

**O** - Overlap all elements and back
